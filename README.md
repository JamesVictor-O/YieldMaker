# Yieldmaker: Simplifying DeFi Yield Investing for Everyone

<!-- ![Yieldmaker Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150?text=Yieldmaker)  -->

**Yieldmaker** is an AI-powered platform that makes decentralized finance (DeFi) yield investing seamless, safe, and accessible to all. Whether you're a crypto novice like a fish seller in a village or an experienced trader, Yieldmaker empowers you to earn yields with confidence, without navigating complex dashboards or risking scams.

## The Problem: DeFi Discovery is Broken
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offers attractive yields, but accessing these opportunities is a nightmare for most users:

- **Information Overload**: Finding reliable DeFi protocols requires juggling multiple platforms (e.g., DeFiLlama, Etherscan, protocol websites), leading to "50 tabs + 10 dashboards" fatigue.
- **Complexity**: Evaluating protocol legitimacy through Total Value Locked (TVL), smart contract audits, and blockchain risks demands technical expertise most users lack.
- **Inaccessibility**: Non-technical users, like small business owners or everyday savers, are excluded due to crypto jargon, wallet setups, and manual transaction processes.
- **Lack of Personalization**: Current tools don’t tailor strategies to individual risk profiles (e.g., conservative vs. aggressive investors).
- **Trust Barriers**: With $3.7B lost to DeFi hacks and scams in 2022 (Chainalysis), users struggle to identify "legit" opportunities, risking capital on unverified protocols.

This complexity alienates millions of potential investors, leaving DeFi’s $100B+ market (per DeFiLlama) accessible only to crypto insiders.

## The Solution: Yieldmaker

**Yieldmaker** is an LLM-powered DeFi agent that simplifies the entire yield investment process into a seamless, beginner friendly experience. Our mission is to democratize DeFi, enabling anyone from a village fish seller to a seasoned trader to safely earn yields with minimal effort.

### Key Features
1. **Conversational AI Interface**  
   - Users describe goals in plain language (e.g., “I want to earn 10% safely with $500”).  
   - The LLM explains strategies in simple terms (e.g., “Lend USDC on Aave for 8% yield, low risk”).  
   - Designed for non-technical users with no crypto knowledge required.

2. **Personalized Risk Profiling**  
   - Assesses user risk tolerance via a quick questionnaire (e.g., “How much can you afford to lose?”).  
   - Matches strategies to preferences (e.g., stablecoin lending for low risk, yield farming for high risk).

3. **Smart Data Aggregation**  
   - Pulls real-time data on yields, TVL, audits, and chain risks from trusted sources (e.g., DeFiLlama, Etherscan, protocol repos).  
   - Simplifies complex metrics into clear insights (e.g., “This protocol is trusted with $1B locked”).

4. **Legitimacy Verification**  
   - Scores protocols and blockchains for safety based on:  
     - **TVL**: High TVL (e.g., >$100M) signals trust and liquidity.  
     - **Audits**: Verifies smart contract audits from reputable firms (e.g., OpenZeppelin).  
     - **Chain Risks**: Assesses blockchain security (e.g., Ethereum’s decentralization).  
     - **Hack History**: Filters out protocols with past exploits.  
   - Ensures only “legit” 10–20% yield opportunities are recommended.

5. **Automated On-Chain Execution**  
   - Connects to wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to deposit funds and rebalance portfolios automatically.  
   - Example: Moves funds from Aave to Compound if yields drop below 10%.  
   - Handles gas fees and multi-chain actions transparently.

6. **Intuitive Mobile-First UI**  
   - Clean, jargon-free interface with visuals (charts, emojis) for yield and risk tracking.  
   - Localized for global users (e.g., supports local languages, currencies like Naira).  
   - Designed for low-tech literacy, perfect for village users.

### User Flow Example
1. A fish seller opens Yieldmaker, inputs: “I have $100 USDC, want to earn safely.”
2. The AI asks: “Can you risk losing 10%? Want 8–15% returns?”
3. Yieldmaker recommends: “Lend on Aave (8% APY, $13B TVL, audited, safe).”
4. The app shows: “Your $100 can earn $8/year. Connect wallet to start.”
5. The user connects a wallet (guided by the app), approves the deposit.
6. Yieldmaker monitors yields and rebalances if needed, keeping it simple.
